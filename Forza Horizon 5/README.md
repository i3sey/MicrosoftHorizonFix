# How to
Download the preferred version for your game above and run the batch file. This version is compatible with Windows 10 Home and Pro editions and should run correctly. Also, it is compatible with Windows 11 Home and Pro editions, but so far Windows 11 has no such problems with the Forza Horizon series. If you experienced some difficulties, you may download the light version for your game, it will run without requesting admin rights and without a services check.
After the batch file starts, it will request admin rights for further operations. It will check for required Xbox services and start them if they're disabled. Then your game will start and after some time explorer.exe process will be killed, it starts again as soon as you exit the game.
